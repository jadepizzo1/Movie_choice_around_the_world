WITH average_top_5 AS
(SELECT SUM(amount)AS total, B.customer_id,first_name,last_name,country,city 
FROM payment A 
INNER JOIN rental B on A.rental_id =B.rental_id 
INNER JOIN customer C on B.customer_id = C.customer_id 
INNER JOIN address D on C.address_id = D.address_id 
INNER JOIN city E on D.city_id = E.city_id 
INNER JOIN country F on E.country_id = F.country_id 
WHERE city IN 
('Aurora','Atlixco','Xintai','Adoni','Dhule','Dhulia','Kurashiki','Pingxiang','Sivas','Celaya','So_Leopoldo') 
GROUP BY B.customer_id,first_name,last_name,country,city 
ORDER BY SUM(amount) DESC 
LIMIT 5)
SELECT AVG(total)
FROM average_top_5
